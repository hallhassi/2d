      SPRING COLLECTION <br /><br />
      2dcloud <br /><br />
      I had a hard time coming up with a way to say this — I want to read all of [ 2dcloud’s ] books. [ 2dcloud is ]
      one of the few publishers who consistently puts out material I love. Maybe that's better than the quote below.
      <br /><br />
      2dcloud has a specific, idiosyncratic voice, like that of an artist. It’s a point of view that’s recognizable,
      but hard to define. It’s art books-meet-comics with a sense of warmth, humanity and vulnerability. It’s pain,
      with hope, always beautiful and surprising.
      &mdash; Keiler Roberts, author of Rat Time, and Chlorine Gardens <br /><br />
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col6 padem13h">
    <p class="alt">
      Nobody is publishing weird, avant-garde, and visually innovative art comix like 2dcloud. It’s the kind of work
      that, by its very nature, will never be lucrative, but they do it because they believe in artists, and I believe
      in them. <br /><br />
      I want to see art with a unique hand. I want artists that tell stories no one else can. I want my visual
      vocabulary expanded when I look at what you do. Comics that look how a comic should look are for babies and for
      the birds.
      &mdash; Julia Gfrörer, author of Laid Waste, and Black is the Color <br /><br />

  <!-- Spring 2020 Intro -->
  <div class="col6 padem13h">
    <p class="alt">
      Daring, exciting, boundary pushing work continues with 2dcloud’s Spring Collection. Copy Kitty by Kyung-Me is
      filled with shimmering, intricate, hypnotic graphite drawings navigating obsessive love and longing. Max
      Baitinger’s inventive and hilariously droll Röhner — translated from the original German, into English — makes its
      American debut. And the Brooklyn artist collective, Plum, presents the gorgeously colorful and lush Mirror Mirror
      3. <br /><br />
      For the first time, this collection features both new and classical books — 6 titles total, all for $39. Sound of
      Snow Falling by Maggie Umber presents an all-painted, extensively researched, wordless nature documentary. Margot
      Ferrick’s Yours is a stunning and evocative collection of love letters — intimate and tactile music on paper. And
      finally, Austin English’s Gulag Casual bridges his fine art and comics practices into one 5 year meditation.

      “...intricate, hypnotic…” <a href="https://selenagallery.co/Kyung-Me" target="_blank">Selena
        Gallery</a><br /><br />
      “A shimmering fake moon, opulent costume changes, and Depression-era Art Deco set the backdrop for this
      spellbinding new narrative from Kyung-Me.”
      <a href="http://the-editorialmagazine.com/kyung-mes/" target="_blank">The Editorial Magazine</a>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      REVIEWS FOR CONIUNCTIO: <br /><br />
      “Kyung-Me’s ultra-precise ink drawings, which resemble both Renaissance etchings and finely wrought
      computer-generated renderings, are windows into starkly glamorous modernist interiors.”
      <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/art/coniunctio" target="_blank">The New
        Yorker</a><br /><br />
      “In a series of grayscale drawings, Kyung-Me renders every wood grain and textile fiber with ink, charcoal, or
      graphite in crisp detail, with no loss from foreground to background. The meticulous clarity is dizzying, even
      hallucinatory. With no singular focus or discernible narrative, the subjectless interior induces a horror vacui
      through its elaborate, often competing patterns.” —The Offing <br /><br />

      REVIEWS FOR BAD KOREAN: </br></br>
      “A charmingly self-deprecating show, Bad Korean is a deeply personal exploration of feeling alienated from both
      one’s own body and one’s environment. Kyung-Me’s sketches initially appear rough and hurried, with loose outlines
      and plain washes of color that carelessly overstep their bounds. Her facial expressions are an exception.
      Consistently illustrated with profound sensitivity, her drawn avatar’s face elucidates a complex conflation of
      conflicted feelings. She offers a rare feminist window into second-generation intersectionality, achieved at a
      human scale.”

        target="_blank">Hyperallergic</a></br></br>
      “Kyung-Me’s drawings, rendered in colored pencil and pastel on paper, show flattened visions of everyday life in
      New York — images of being optimistic and confused and gross and lonely and lost and hungry and in love.”

      Adult picture book comprised of intricate, surreal graphite illustrations that tell the tale of obsessive love and
      longing and the maddening, self-inflicted contortions of identity endured to fit perceived expectations and norms.
      <br /><br />
      Copy Kitty explores themes of identity, belonging and love through a cat who painfully and continually reinvents
      itself in pursuit of adoration and an elusive ideal. Autobiographically driven, the narrative strikes a chord
      through common experiences conveyed authentically, with sharp perspective and deep reflection on the
      self-destructive consequences of perceived ideals and sublimation of identity. <br /><br />
    </p>

  <div class="col6 padem13h">
    <p class="alt">
      The format of the book presents each of the highly detailed illustrations alternating with a blank page. Copy
      Kitty is based on a series of illustrations Kyung-Me exhibited at galleries in NY, which were met with strong
      critical acclaim. In 2018, work from Copy Kitty was featured in Artspace, having been selected on the favorites
      list from the New York NADA preview by prominent art collectors Susan and Michael Hort. </br></br>
      Kyung-Me is an artist and illustrator living in New York. She is represented by Bureau, NY. She holds an MFA in
      painting from the Yale School of Art and has participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions in New York
      galleries and beyond. She is best known for her series of illustrations and debut graphic novel, Bad Korean,
      critically acclaimed by Vice, Huffington Post, and Hyperallergic. </br></br>

      Röhner expertly shows off Max's inventive draftsmanship, droll wit, and precise cartooning. It's one of my
      favorite books for 2020.
      &mdash; Gina Wynbrandt, author of Someone Please Have Sex With Me <br /><br />
      Max is such a good observer of interpersonal relations, and therefore a great storyteller. Needless to say that
      his drawings are magnetic. I keep staring at them and think: How did he do that? Röhner is one of my favorite

      Baitinger leaves the reader in the dark about the big picture. He prefers to show details: how the protagonist
      spins his appointment calendar in the air to indicate that he has no time. The way aluminium confetti pours out of
      a letter onto a shag rug. Baitinger breaks up an everyday matter like brewing coffee into many small steps, each
      in an individual image: ‘Switch on boiler. Insert pot. Fill tank. Insert filter.

      Previously published in German by Rotopol Press, Röhner is a delightfully detailed field guide to the everyday
      tasks of living in an apartment — making coffee, watering plants, and maintaining order and a careful balance with
      neighbors — until that order is upset.
      <br /><br />
      Max Baitinger’s dry humor and precise drawings deftly personify his über persnickety protagonist, simply referred
      to as P., whose regimented life is disrupted by the arrival of Röhner, an unloved houseguest, who imposes upon his
      psyche and offsets the careful balance with his gregarious, omnipresent neighbor. Devious tricks and hilarious
      imaginations of Röhner’s elimination take shape, from painstakingly making up Röhner’s guest room and then
      piercing the air mattress to cause a slow leak — to visions of an exploding coffee pot tearing off Röhner’s face.

      This is not a comics anthology that just compiles various contributions by different
      artists but rather one that can only exist as one piece, one that was created by three parts of one body with
      a shared vision. These stories don’t make you see the individual artists behind them - these stories want to
      tell you that they created themselves and will keep recreating even after you put the book down. A living
      organism of the most convincing examples that show how masterful and unpretentiously poetic comics can
      be.

      Lush dancing forms in kaleidoscopic color and style, Mirror Mirror 3 is animated, playful
