            Yearbooks is by Nicholas Breutzman, co-authored by Shaun Feltz, and colored by Raighne Hogan. High school is a dreary spell and the schoolhouse is filled with drowning children. Teachers turn into Moonbats, firing guano onto the unsuspecting children below. This bizarre nightmare sets the tone for comics newcomer Nicholas Breutzman’s garishly colored over-sized debut effort. Breutzman's rubbery realism reminds one of characters from Daniel Clowes’ Eightball, while the narrative contains elements of overwhelming dread not unlike a Todd Solondz film, and the vivid colors evoke something straight out of a Lauren Weinstein comic. It is easy to see how Yearbooks was given an honorable mention in the Neil Gaiman edited Best American Comics 2010.<br/><br/>
            Yearbooks made several 'Best of Lists': The Comics Journal's Top 50 Comics of 2009 at #24, File Under Other's Best of 2009, Cartoonist Noah Van Sciver described it as one of his favorite comics of 2010 on Inkstuds <br/><br/>

            Chilling... [Yearbooks] raises an interesting issue vis-a-vis the relationship between an artist and their responsibilities as a moral agent in the world. Can art be evil if it's made by predators, or is this entirely in the eye of the beholder?

            The story, from creepy dream sequence to almost apocalyptic ending, perfectly captures the creepiness and angst of high school, and Nicholas' art only adds to the effect.

            Breutzman's comic is vivid, unsettling and altogether more believable than you’d perhaps like it to be.

            Strange, gross, and lovely, Yearbooks is just connected enough to real high school memories to really freak you out...<br/>
            &mdash; Jessica Abel<br/><br/>
            Nic Breutzman's comics are often beguiling, sometimes disorienting, and always formally inventive. Yearbooks is a quick sucker punch that will leave you feeling uneasy but eager for more.<br/>
