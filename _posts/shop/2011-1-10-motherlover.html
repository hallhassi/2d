                Motherlover is by Nicholas Breutzman, John & Luke Holden, and Raighne Hogan, with a foreword by Rob Clough. Funding provided in part by <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/765505753/motherlover-an-anthology-of-comics" target="_blank">kickstarter</a>.<br/><br/>

                Motherlover is a tightly-knit anthology, modeling itself off of Drawn & Quarterly’s since retired annual showcase. This one-off volume pairs Minnesotan creators Nicholas Breutzman, John & Luke Holden, and editor Raighne Hogan together for woodsy and weird excursions in dark comedy. Mood rings, disaffected twenty-somethings in NYC, unsupervised nine-year olds in the pursuit, nay, NEED, of finding a porno tape, and suburban white boys buying fake crack — Minnesota’s finest!<br/><br/>

                [Motherlover] has a way of evoking dread and malaise in equal measure. <br/>
                &mdash; Rob Clough </br></br>

                Breutzman’s style is unusual in that he mixes naturalism in terms of his backgrounds and character designs with slightly loose, rubbery expressions on his characters’ faces. <br/>
                &mdash; The Comics Journal <br/><br/>

                ...the world is weird and the world is uncomfortable.<br/>
