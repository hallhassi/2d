          Startled Maggie is an auto-bio serial focusing on a mischievous little spit-fire. Drawn in light pencil, this new series is pointed at the ephemeral qualities of memory and what makes early life such a funny and charming place. <br/><br/>

          This has the potential to be a downright fascinating series when all is said and done.
