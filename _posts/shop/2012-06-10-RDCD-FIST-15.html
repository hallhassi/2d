          Skarhus is an interesting thinker, and I like the way he juxtaposes simplistic scenes of violence that are the core of most genre comics with a sort of phenomenology of the entire experience of exploring the space, experiencing the fight and watching the fight all at once, both as a "real" event and as a contrived ritual done for putative entertainment.

          [A] discrete objet dâ€™art. Inside, it offers a dizzying descent into wavy black and white lines, like an old TV scramble, toward an authoritarian environment of some possible future reality. <br/>
