          Levitating disembodied cow heads, crack witches, mutant children, urban myths, half-remembered folklore: from the minds of Noah Van Sciver and Nic Breutzman comes Deep in the Woods, a double feature that pairs two of 2dcloud’s favorite cartoonists in one oversized newsprint. <br/><br/>

          Robin, the dutiful daughter of a drunk runs away from her home, an evil step-family, deeper into the haunted woods. Who knows what she’ll find? Whiskey's solace? A floating cow head's kiss? Find out in Noah Van Sciver’s The Cow’s Head. <br/><br/>

          Heartbroken Sammy must convince her grandfather to crawl out of the well he’s holed himself up in. But first, it’s a walk through the woods with googly eyed mutant brothers and a stop at the crack witches hut for a ssssmoke. Take a toke with Nicholas Breutzman’s The Mayfly.<br/><br/>

          The tales provide a nice one/two, with van Sciver’s art style typically looser, visceral, all dense blacks, while his comic is lighter in tone and humour, providing a complimentary contrast to  Bretzman’s fine lined, clean, cartoony illustrations, but inherently darker story.

          Van Sciver provides an atmospheric and creepy little adventure in these pages revolving around ideas of self-sacrifice and integrity.

          Is Noah Van Sciver the finest cartoonist of his generation? It certainly seems like he’s on the path to earn that title... and Breutzman does [] well enough here that I’m going to keep an eye out for what he does next time.

        ...two words that first come to mind when I consider Breutzman's story are bleak and surreal. Every character is fucked up in some way -- either they're on drugs, or they're emotionally devastated, or they're some sort of bizarre mutant, or they're an oddball combination of all three.
