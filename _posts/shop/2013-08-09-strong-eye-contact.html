            Strong Eye Contact stars an unnamed immigrant and aspiring comedian as he tries to make his way in America.
            It is a <a href="http://on-panel.com/BAC2014/" target="_blank">BEST AMERICAN COMICS</a> 2014 Notable title,
            selected by Bill Kartalopoulos. <br /><br />
            Part comic strip collection, part art book, the reader is led by this quixotic, Buster Keaton-like figure
            through a kaleidoscope of crystalline memory fragments, he tries, with limited success, to be a typical
            American: using consumer products, failed vacations, and fabricated family life. <br /><br />
            Using mediums often associated with childhood mark-making (crayons, colored pens, markers) gives the book a
            simplistic sheen that belies the formal sophistication operating just beneath the surface. This day to day
            saga is wet and alive; landscapes pop with mountainous close-ups, cacti, abstracted-patterns, confusion,
            vast empty spaces and gaps – cartooning as a potent puzzle where the strangest magic happens inside the
            reader's mind. <br /><br />
            ...Adams takes [comics] further, deconstructing linear storytelling and blurring the line between
            wakefulness and dreaming.

            There's a vividness to each image that speaks to Adams' background as a painter [while t]he way that he
            "rhymes" images back and forth speaks to his background as a musician; each strip very much feels like the
            verse of a song...

            This is the graphic novel as abstract expressionism ... at once disorienting and mesmerizing...

            This is one of the most unique, 'no similarities to any other working cartoonist whatsoever,' totally out of
            left field books I've come across in a while. <br />
            &mdash; Austin English </br></br>
            I like this Strong Eye Contact thing... LOL. Fucking weird [a]nd quite pretty. <br />
            &mdash; Simon Hanselmann </br></br>
            Rarely have magic markers worked such luminous brilliance. <br />
            &mdash; Matt Seneca </br></br>
            Weird, imaginative, and raw. Adams creates a textural experience leading you through the follies of his
            character's life. <br />
            &mdash; Aidan Koch </br></br>
            A bloody Q-tip, the crumbs of a waffle and an airplane on fire...it all comes together with Christopher's
            unique drawing system. Is the comedian dreaming or is the comedy a dream? <br />
            &mdash; Eamon Espey </br></br>
            Like a Mr. Hulot transposed into the America of soft-serve and mini-golf, Adams’ comedian is a normal guy
            trying to deal with work and relaxation in a landscape of perplexing patterns. <br />
            &mdash; Matthew Thurber </br></br>
