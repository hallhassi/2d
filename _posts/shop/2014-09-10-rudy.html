      Rudy is the best.
      &mdash; John Porcellino<br /><br />
      Intuitive and spontaneous rather than practiced and formalistic,[these] hilarious, doodled-in-a-notebook-style
      comics emerge triumphantly from the id.

      Rudy, a collection spanning over 20 years of comics and zines by Mark Connery, is a delightfully strange, funny,
      and metaphysical trip. With pants-wearing fish, shape-shifting triangles, talking eyeballs, rude ugly duckling
      youths, and of course our titular magic cat, Rudy, Connery’s absurdist irreverence permeates his work. With the
      turn of every page, Rudy beats with a poet’s heart. Words alone cannot capture the magic that is Rudy. It must be
      read to be believed! <br /><br />

      A comedic timing worthy of Bushmiller has been transplanted into an anarchist scratch-scape… I LOVE RUDY!
      &mdash; Matthew Thurber <br /><br />
      After reading Rudy, my brain began to rewrite itself... Connery inverted my artistic values...

      When I first saw his work it felt truly and completely new. And the funny thing is, reading the material in this
      book over a decade later, it still feels that way.
