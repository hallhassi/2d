            Dragon's Breath is a funny, intimate and sometimes sad ode to multiplicity. Each episode comes over you like a puff of smoke, and with it comes both a little cough and the rich scent of fresh tobacco.

            MariNaomi knows how to weave in a sense of the comic, so that moments of deep despair are always balanced with some levity and even mirth ... A highly recommended read from a new and exciting independent publisher.

            Mari is a brilliant artist, compelling storyteller and bonafide dragonslayer.
            &mdash; Brodie Hubbard <br/><br/>

            What is so appealing is how MariNaomi shares a life, one that is distinct in its details, yet connected. Here is another woman searching for love, risk, and connection amid the hubbub of the contemporary -- boyfriends, best friends, bedbugs, exes, rock music and rentals.

            [MariNaomi] reminds us about those special fleeting moments of beauty and those dark places in our psyches that we bury.
