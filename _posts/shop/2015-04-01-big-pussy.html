          When cats and anime characters are your only guides into adulthood and sexuality, you know you’re in for a funny trip. Big Pussy is new comic by Chicagoan cartoonist and funny-woman, Gina Wynbrandt! <br/><br/>
          Big Pussy got Wynbrandt nominated for a Promising New Talent Ignatz in 2015. <br/><br/>
          I watched Gina read from “Big Pussy” at TCAF in 2015, and it was a highlight of the festival.

          Wynbrandt's willingness to go to any extreme for a joke is at its zenith here, and the varying shades of pink only add to the story's ridiculous atmosphere.

          This hole of wanton self-flagellation (both types) was nominated for an Ignatz, but it would still make John Waters Himself shake His head in shame. And yes, you sick fucks, there's cat sex. Come, take a dive in the Lisa Frank dumpster that is Gina Wynbrandt's brain.
