            Finally, we are permitted to peek into the horrid pile left in the bin outside the building of the former Xeric grant office. The building has been closed for a while now, and like one would expect, the state of this original manuscript has been compromised considerably over the years, some might even say 'edited' by the forces of nature. <br/>

          Drawn in 2010 and never completed or published, Tracy Auch's gothic, grotesque, and fragmentary epic is presented for the first time in this riso-printed ashcan edition. The anxious and darkly comic narrative takes place in an all-male world in which sexual reproduction does not exist and the primary class division in society is between men and children. With the thematic sensibility of Nikolai Gogol's short stories and the suggestive, world-building scope of British roleplaying fantasy art, The Necrophilic Landscape is certain to enthrall and disgust readers who can finally encounter it for the first time.<br/><br/>
