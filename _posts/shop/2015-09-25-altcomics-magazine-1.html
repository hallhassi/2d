        Over the past 6 months we have started laying the groundwork for our most ambitious project yet, a feature-length documentary on contemporary cartoonists and the largely fragmented industry they navigate. Altcomics Magazine will act as a printed companion, released on a quarterly basis. This first collector's issue features Aidan Koch drawing in Central Park, Sab in the Upper West Side, Lala Albert &amp; Leah Wishnia in Lala's Bushwick bedroom studio, and Nou, the cover artist.
