                    ITDN Group published a series of comics pamphlets from 2010&mdash;2014. Each issue was anonymously authored and included the possibility of being created by a different person. The 'group' &mdash; plural, informal, and rigid &mdash; is the only thing cohering the series together. A follow-up to Qviet, this collection documents Burkholder's earlier years, providing insights into his explorations of the themes and concepts that underpin many of his more broadly received works.

                    One morning at a gig space in Baltimore I watched Andy Burkholder pick up a tube of leftover frosting and use it to casually draw a simple but legible comic strip onto a piece of cardboard. His uninhibited intelligence and direct style create the conditions for breakthrough work. ITDN is the laboratory from which his later achievements have emerged.<br/>
