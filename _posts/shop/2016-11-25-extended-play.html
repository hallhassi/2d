                Extended Play, the debut collection by Jake Terrell, seizes upon the millennial zeitgeist from an array
                of angles. From the haze of summer to the conflicting feelings of ennui and hope that guide the figures
                in Terrell’s magical realist landscapes, there’s an effortlessness to his work that obscures the
                heightened sense of understanding he brings to the form. Jake Terrell is a cartoonist and illustrator
                based in Brooklyn, NY. His comics have a loose, confident line, often focusing on a youth-centric cast
                of characters written into magical realist or measured fantastical narratives. <br /><br />

                "Extended Play” is an apt title. The pleasure of Terrell's line, and his
                storytelling, is infectious. It’s a battle cry for cartooning as mark making, as line design, for
                thinking of drawing as handwriting and a form of searching and discovery. It may be his first book,
                but already he seems to understand what IT is, better than most. I could read his work all day long.
