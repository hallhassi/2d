            Sprawling Heart is an intimate musical of paper, paint, and ink. Inward rumination's reach outward as exhalation's and a whisper becomes a sumptuous song. <br/><br/>

            Sab Meynert is an artist &amp; writer based in Toronto, whose work has been recognized as a melodic counterpoint to the independent arts publishing sector. Their work spins poetic imagery &amp; text to weave maps of visceral emotions and the multiformity of life's infinitely unfolding nature. Between independently published artist multiples, national &amp; international gallery shows, grant-funded bodies of work, collaborative initiatives with high profile musicians &amp; artists, and their September world-distributed publishing debut, Sprawling Heart, Meynert is an embodiment of the artist working in dynamic multiplicity. <br/><br/>

            2dcloud has never been afraid to publish books that don't neatly fit into categories, and Meynert's book is no exception. I believe it's best described as an illustrated prayer and invocation for healing. The lush illustrations, including delicate pencil drawings, elaborate design work and vibrant use of color, give the eye something powerful to work with when paired against the relatively spare use of text. The prayer is about staying open, staying aware, looking for help and looking for connections. There's a repeating visual motif of flowering amidst an open hand, representing perhaps that it's important to understand how to be open to the things life can offer you, that one's mental state is key to accepting or not accepting what life has to offer, in all of its incarnations. The comic is all about flow, fluidity and water's paradox in being droplets and a wave all at once. That metaphor is used to explain our position relative to others: we are all water, whether we realize it or not, and we can either flow or resist--but the river will always keep moving. <a href='http://highlowcomics.blogspot.ca/2017/05/2dcloud-sprawling-heart-perfect-hair.html'>Rob Clough</a> <br/><br/>

            Meynert's work is both graphic and lush, whether it's a hand-printed zine or full-scale drawing. <a href='http://www.cbc.ca/beta/arts/sab-meynert-tcaf-comics-1.3578900'>CBC Arts</a> <br/><br/>

            Sab Meynert is a Toronto illustrator whose works look like they could have been created digitally, but really they are meticulously rendered pen/marker drawings. <a href='http://www.juxtapoz.com/news/illustration/sab-meynerts-surreal-pen-drawings/'>Juxtapoz</a> <br/><br/>
