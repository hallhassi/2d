                A paint and paper documentary, observing great horned owls in their natural habitat. <br /><br />
                Sound of Snow Falling is a graphic novel done in a poetic documentary mode. In this unique work, the
                reader becomes a voyeur of the natural world, following a great horned owl family through the dead of
                winter. Extensively researched and expressively painted, Sound of Snow Falling is a triumph of the
                comics form. <br /><br />
                It is a <a href="http://on-panel.com/BAC2018/" target="_blank">BEST AMERICAN COMICS</a> 2018 Notable
                title, selected by Bill Kartalopoulos. <br /><br />

                Mesmerizing... As in nature, the more you look, the more you see.
                &mdash; Julie Zickefoose, author &amp; illustrator of Baby Birds: An Artist Looks Into the Nest, The

                Umber beautifully uses comic form to take the reader through intimate movements in nature.
                &mdash; Aidan Koch <br /><br />
                Umber has captured a small reflection of the natural divine. <a

                Umber's thrillingly inventive approach to cartooning constitutes an act of real empathy with the earth,
                an attempt to embrace the alterity and sovereignty of the sentient life that surrounds us. <a
