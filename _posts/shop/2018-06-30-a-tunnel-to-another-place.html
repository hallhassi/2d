<!-- A TUNNEL TO ANOTHER PLACE by Apolo Cacho COPY -->
<div class='topm6 description'>
    <div class="col6 padem13h">
        <p class="alt">
          A Tunnel to Another Place is a parable with pop beats; political and poetic. Spidery lines trace the decay of capitalism’s modern mythology with fantastical flourish. <br/><br/>
          Apolo Cacho is from Mexico City. Since 2011 he has self-published his work through photocopies and low cost printing systems, developing an activity that covers painting, comic books and drawing. He was selected for a residence at La Maison des Auteurs in Angoulême, France, in 2014, where he worked on a project based on the violent events that took place in his country. <br/><br/>

        <p class="alt">
          Apolo Cacho’s work [is] a mixture of perverse, obscure, morbid but also magical and beautiful.

          A dystopian wasteland stretches as far as the eye can see in the world of Apolo Cacho.
