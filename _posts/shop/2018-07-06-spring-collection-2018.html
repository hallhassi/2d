          Driving through distant horizons — spring is here and summer is not far off. All of the books are printed or are actively printing. It will take approximately 2-3 months for the last batch of titles to ship from the printer in South Korea, to our distributors warehouse in Jackson, Tennessee, to our offices in Chicago, Illinois and finally out to you. Delivery of this collection is scheduled for sometime in August. <br/><br/>
          IMPORTANT NOTE: for international customers, please email us at: info [at] 2dcloud [dot] com for shipping details prior to purchasing. <br/><br/>

          NOCTURNE by Tara Booth <br/><br/>

        <p class="alt">
          Unable to sleep, Tara takes too much sleep medication and enters a dream soaked fantasia. A vivid and moody, euphoric journey where dreams and hallucinations intersect. <br/><br/>
          In this wordless graphic novella, Booth covers autobiographical themes of mental health, anxiety, and issues of consent. Nocturne is Booth's first wide release, following her critically acclaimed, short-run debut, DUII. <br/><br/>
          Tara Booth is a 28 year old illustrator and comics artist from Philadelphia. Her work has been featured on Mashable and in Bloomberg Magazine, Hi Lo, and The Lifted Brow, among other magazines and websites — but she’s probably best known for her content on Instagram, where she has over 60K followers. Her work was recognized and featured by It's Nice That as part of World Mental Health Day in 2017. <br/><br/>
        </p>

    <div class="col6 padem13h">
        <p class="alt">
          Tara understands the language of comics fully. Her stories slide past the analytical part of the brain and directly into a deeper, more gratifying kind of understanding. Her bright colors bring joy and humor to the heaviest, darkest follies hidden inside ourselves.
          &mdash; Gabrielle Bell, Everything is Flammable </br></br>
          As an artist, Booth works to push the boundaries between comic arts and fine art, and she lives up to no standards of appropriateness other than her own. Her social commentary is sharp and her visual storytelling unassuming.
          &mdash; Megan St Clair, Hyperallergic </br></br>
          Comic book artist and illustrator Tara Booth’s work is candid, funny and chock full of personal details. The textures and patterns she achieves using gouache paint give her work a wonderfully awkward tone and she brings her characters to life through short vignettes that unfold on the page.
          &mdash; Rebecca Fulleylove, It's Nice That</br></br>

          FLUORESCENT MUD by Eli Howey <br/><br/>
          7 x 10" • 116pp • full color offset • smyth-sewn • MSRP $16.95 <br/><br/>
          Entirely hand painted in watercolor and gouache, Fluorescent Mud is a surreal art comic with underlying themes of transition and dissociation. <br/><br/>

<div class='topm6 description'>
    <div class="col6 padem13h">
        <p class="alt">
          Flourescent Mud follows the main character through a series of seemingly unrelated and unexplainable experiences, taking into account various states of mind/memories/ thoughts/feelings and sensory experiences that affect a subjective retelling of events. <br/><br/>
          Eli Howey is an artist and printmaker currently based in Toronto. They use traditional analogue printmaking techniques to create contemporary narrative artbooks and large-scale works on paper. They use a combination of images and poetry to construct narrative artwork that expresses multiple dimensions of each situation. Their work attempts to go beyond what can be seen, to incorporate the emotional and imagined spaces within environments and stories. <br/><br/>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col6 padem13h">
        <p class="alt">
          Eli Howey's Fluorescent Mud pulls the reader in with drawings so haunting and hallucinatory that the pages seem to pitch and swell, like the surface of the ocean at night lit up by bioluminescent algae. As I read, I felt that I was becoming a presence in the mind of the protagonist, looking over their shoulder while they navigated eerie moonlit landscapes, and vividly sensing the intensity of their turbulent mental state.
          &mdash; Sophia Foster-Dimino, Sex Fantasy </br></br>
          Eli paints dissociation like nobody else. Their work is lush and queasy, and makes me feel like I'm having a panic attack. Fluorescent Mud is a work of genius, and it hits really really hard.

          6 x 6" • 136pp • full color offset • smythsewn • MSRP $14.95 <br/><br/>

          An artist's field guide on owls and owl behavior. Maggie Umber once again takes readers into nature, showing the beauty and sophistication of animals in their natural habitats. 270º is an educational glimpse of owls found in North America and beyond. <br/><br/>
          Maggie Umber is a cartoonist, painter and printmaker. She has published two graphic novels with 2dcloud: Time Capsule (2015) and Sound of Snow Falling (2017). Her work has appeared in two anthologies Warmer: A collection of comics about climate change for the fearful & hopeful edited by Andrew White and Madeleine Witt (2017) and The Shirley Jackson Project edited by Rob Kirby and published by Ninth Art Press (2016). Maggie is one of the publishers at 2dcloud. <br/><br/>

          Umber captures the spirit of nature — its glory and grace — in her beautifully crafted, mixed media comics.
          &mdash; Alyssa Berg, ALPENGLOW </br></br>
          Maggie Umber’s 270° is beautiful to experience and the narrative engrossing. I was pulled in to the reality of the Owls. A fascinating read, gorgeously depicted.
          &mdash; Mike Dawson, WHY DID THEY COME? </br></br>
          When 270º, Maggie Umber’s second beautifully illustrated book on owls reached me I could not put it down until I had absorbed all its delightful owl and other artwork from cover to cover. This book will turn heads and make the viewers turn pages. The playful layout and creative and diverse artwork seduces the reader into absorbing the subtle but factual information woven throughout these pages. The words sometimes blend into the images, like grass, twigs and branches of the owls’ habitats. Maggie has created a book of owls that reminds even the most objective owl scientists like me that there are other aesthetically pleasing ways to know owls.

          Nothing stretches or bends, there is no movement, no animation, no life in static images. But by looking at these pared-down and simple pictures in sequence, you catch glimpses that would indicate otherwise—and that indication is magical. Before your eyes, these abstract simple lines, geometric shapes, and grids come to life. Vanishing Perspective is a comic book in which the reader is light itself. <br/><br/>
          Alexis Beauclair lives in France. His acclaimed illustrations and comics have been featured in the New York Times, Pitchfork Review, and Real Life. <br/><br/>
          Where did this man come from? [...] lines so delicate they’re like hairs that have dropped onto a scanner from above. Who knew making a series of pictures in navy triangles and circles could be so beautiful?

    <div class="col6 padem13h">
        <p class="alt">
          We often expect comics to tell us the stories of adventures. Alexis Beauclair does precisely this and nothing else, but his work extends, synthesizes, crystallizes, refines and intensifies this tradition. "Action" is the watchword of his narratives, which follow the path of looking and the stages of perception to reconstitute the movement of an intelligence. Alexis Beauclair's comics tell us the story of the adventure of drawing. And (almost) nothing else.
          &mdash; Laurent Bruel, Editions Matière </br></br>
          Alexis Beauclair's minimalism makes generous play of the act of reading comics. Recalling the lively abstract animation of Viking Eggeling, Oskar Fischinger, and Al Jarnow, Beauclair's formalism is intellectual but never academic. His precise, linear images reveal themselves to be shaded with humor and humanity in their juxtaposition and arrangement.
          &mdash; Bill Kartalopoulos, Series Editor for the #1 New York Times best selling Best American Comics series </br></br>

          6 x 6" • 80pp • 1 color risograph printed • spiral-bound • MSRP $25 <br/><br/>
          Rough hewn cartooning pulls against a tightly formalized page logic as we're led through a memoryscape of dead-end friendships. <br/><br/>

          The strange, brooding style evokes teenage sketchbook drawings that, when coupled with the fatalistic stoner narrative, conjure feelings of youthful confusion cut with brutal certainty. Friendship is the body: skin, muscle, bones; the body comes together, the body comes apart. Wander Maunder manages to relate despite itself. <br/><br/>
          Justin Skarhus is a former associate publisher at 2dcloud and cartoonist based in Minneapolis. He has published small editions of minicomics via 2dcloud and appeared in Jason T.

          Skarhus' comics are sharp at first glance, confounding at second and ultimately overflow with information that the reader is richly rewarded for unraveling. A puzzle of thought and emotion surge through these pages.

          A small zine that feels like a cassette demo, filled with short unfinished first take tracks about love, heartbreak, and feelings.  <br/><br/>

          Past lovers bleed into one another as moody sketches and hazy memories. It Felt Like Nothing is both colorful and murky, much like unrequited love. <br/><br/>

          Anyone can feel the soft, painful vulnerability in Fifi Martinez’s work. The brash depictions of her personal relationships and lonely, depressive internal monologue emit an honest intensity that can make anyone reflect on their past life with tears. Her frantic line work and obsessive layering carries the reader through the anxiety of her life. Fifi’s persistent growth as an artist and person can only inspire hope in the insecure and miserable.

          Gustave Flaubert Trois Contes is a comic that is paced like a film, shot all in one take — thoughts and dialogue are indiscriminately conjured on the page, making for a stream of consciousness styled reading experience. <br/><br/>
          Christopher Adams is an artist and musician. He has published several books with 2dcloud including "Strong Eye Contact" and "Yule Log", both listed as "Notable" in Best American Comics.  <br/><br/>
          'Gustave Flaubert Trois Contes' beguiled me on my first read and opened up to greater and greater depths on each return visit. It is a funny and complex book about the porous border between art and life that operates on more than trois levels—a comic about its own making whose self-awareness is intimate and revelatory.

          Wtf did I just read? I've gone back to it over and over and the details get funnier and more bonkers with each pass. There are so many subtleties, it's not for the casual reader. Must pace with pure joy, this arcane glimpse into the mind of Chris Adams.

          haha wow this is really weird chris. ok oh jeez i've never tried to blurb before it's harder than i thought! if you enjoy a one-word blurb i would say "disorienting" which i mean as a compliment but it might not read that way i guess? dunno? i put a letter complaining about how my comics suck on the back of my book so i might have a different approach to this than someone else in general i now realize lol or how about: "Like finding out you're the people in Powers of Ten just before getting kicked out of the theater you're watching it in." i worked on that one! is that a blurb? i might not know how to do this also can i just say i am in love with this radiator you drew i don't know why
