        Mirror Mirror 3 is a vibrant maelstrom of mixed media, arriving at a stunning intersection of innocence, joy,
        and color.<br /><br />

      <p class="alt">
        This is not a comics anthology that just compiles various contributions by different
        artists but rather one that can only exist as one piece, one that was created by three parts of one body with
        a shared vision. These stories don’t make you see the individual artists behind them - these stories want to
        tell you that they created themselves and will keep recreating even after you put the book down. A living
        organism of the most convincing examples that show how masterful and unpretentiously poetic comics can
        be.
        &mdash; Aisha Franz, author of Shit is Real <br /><br />

        Lush dancing forms in kaleidoscopic color and style, Mirror Mirror 3 is animated, playful
        and delicious. A collection of delightfully joyous work vibrating with creative vigor. An ornate dream box of
        beautifully wrapped candies you've never tried before.
        &mdash; Lale Westvind, author of Grip <br /><br />

        Plum was the best thing at MoCCA this year.

          Mirror Mirror 3 was produced in partnership with the editors and authors at Plum Press, a small publisher and

          by each of the authors, with collaborative work connecting the stories. Themes throughout include nature,
          introspection and interpersonal relationships. Plum’s imagery is vibrant, emotive, and mythic. <br /><br />
