    <p class="alt">
      Adult picture book comprised of intricate, surreal graphite illustrations that tell the tale of obsessive love and
      longing and the maddening, self-inflicted contortions of identity endured to fit perceived expectations and norms.
      <br /><br />
      "Each drawing in this series took twenty hours, and is full of references to Korean art, Looney Tunes, and 1950s
      illustrations. While it’s a surreal tale, the universally relatable themes of identity and acceptance allow the
      viewer to easily digest Kyung-Me’s elaborately detailed, black and white drawings, and the ideas present sit close
      to home."
      &mdash; Rebecca Fulleylove, editor at Google Arts & Culture <br /><br />
      Copy Kitty explores themes of identity, belonging and love through a cat who painfully and continually reinvents
      itself in pursuit of adoration and an elusive ideal. Autobiographically driven, the narrative strikes a chord
      through common experiences conveyed authentically, with sharp perspective and deep reflection on the
      self-destructive consequences of perceived ideals and sublimation of identity. <br /><br />
