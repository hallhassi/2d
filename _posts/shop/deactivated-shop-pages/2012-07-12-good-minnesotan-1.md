2D Cloud's comic debut. 5 comic shorts. Our humble beginnings.

Shannon Smith, of File Under Other, has this to say about GMN 1, "[A]s far as first issues go this one is a gem."

"More like this please!" Kevin Bramer of Optical Sloth writes. "[T]his book as a concept is exactly whatâ€™s needed to keep this medium going strong: regional anthologies."

Richard Krauss of Comic Related says, "If you enjoy experimental storytelling or discovering the work of a new crop of cartoonists, you'll love Good Minnesotan."
