Good Minnesotan 3 by Anna Bongiovanni, Nicholas Breutzman, Noah Harmon, Meghan Hogan, Raighne Hogan, John & Luke Holden, Toby Jones, Reynold Kissling, Dank!/Danno Klonowski, Ed Moorman, Abby Mullen, Justin Skarhus, Madeline Queripel

Nicholas Breutzman's contribution My Town was one of the American Best Comics Notables of 2010.

"The third episode of this comic art compendium is the most ambitious and diverse yet," says Richard Krauss on Midnight Fiction.

Rob Clough of High-Low writes, "Minnesota is fertile ground for comics talent these days. The GOOD MINNESOTAN anthology proves that there's a full-blown comics scene, rapidly improving from issue to issue."

"It is a fantastic looking book with quality and content comparable to Fantagraphic's Mome series. It is a really solid anthology with material ranging from the cute the disturbing," Shannon Smith of File Under Other says. He included GMN 3 on his Best of 2009 List.
