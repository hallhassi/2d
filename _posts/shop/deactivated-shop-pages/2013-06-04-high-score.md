__24 pages, 4" x 5" pamphlet, color cover and full color interior__

_High Score_ was edited & designed by Raighne Hogan, with comics by Hannah Blumenreich, Peter Wartman, Eric Schuster, Saman Bemel-Benrud & Toby Jones.

_High Score: A Microcomic Anthology on Videogame History_ was created as a limited pledge reward for Rusel DeMaria's Kickstarter for [the 3rd edition of High Score: An Illustrated History of Electronic Games](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/230165553/game-history-book-high-score-3rd-edition).

> I’ve never seen a more delightful collection of comics compiled in such a small amount of space before. Through 24 pages, this mini-comic presents five different artists with exceptionally different styles, retelling a piece of video game’s past.
