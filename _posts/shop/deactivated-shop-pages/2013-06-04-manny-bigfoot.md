A mysterious ransom note and a vist from a sweater-stretching Bigfoot are too much for Manny and his bunny.

Premiered at Walker Art Center's Multiples Mall.

> If you like artsy comics with a handmade, craftsperson feel, it doesn't get any better than this... The presentation of this mini comic is gorgeous. The color and images are artfully produced and almost look as if the pages and panels were painted rather than printed. The pastel colors have a matte texture that helps transport the reader to Hogan's fanciful world.
