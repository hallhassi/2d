> I really enjoyed The Death of Elijah Lovejoy. Van Sciver told the story well and his cartooning is solid.

Chester Brown

> A fascinating little tale, an informative history lesson and a glimpse into the past of our country that should not be forgotten.

Matt Brady of Warren Peace

> [I]t’s a stirring account; the power of which is capably re-enforced by Van Sciver’s animated artwork and intense sense of pacing

Andy Oliver of Broken Frontier. 

> The comic was printed by La Mano, Zak Sally's own press. The quality of the paper and hand-made nature of the printing process make this a beautiful little art object. For an artist like Van Sciver, who does a lot of cross-hatching and employs a lot of thick blacks, the ink has an almost visceral quality on the page.
