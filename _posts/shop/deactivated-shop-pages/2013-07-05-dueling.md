_Dueling_ is the deleted introduction to _The Hypo: The Melancholic Young Lincoln_. Because it did not make the cut, the backgrounds are not finished, providing a behind-the-scenes look into the craft of comic-making. [Preview here](http://nvansciver.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/dueling-comic/).

> It’s immediately obvious that Noah isn’t going to offer just attention to detail, it’s beyond that, it’s a commitment to detail. It’s evident there in the painstaking wisps of hair, the blood spatters when people are shot with antiquated .50 caliber rounds, or the flecks of color in the cover stock. It’s there in the running adherence to heavier inks, bolder use of negative space, and the sheer depth of field present in every shot..."
