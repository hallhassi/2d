Difficult Loves by Molly Colleen O'Connell, published by Domino Books

Core member of the art collective Closed Caption Comics (CCC), Molly Colleen O'Connell brings us her richest book to date. The reader is at first confronted with O'Connell's signature fleshy characters. Lurking around them this time are snakes---real and implied.

Difficult Loves was #2 on Comics Reporter reader Brian Nicholson's "Pick Five Comics From 2012 You'd Be Happy To See On A Best Of 2012 List". Sean T. Colins of the Comics Journal writes, "O’Connell’s weapons of choice are perspective and detail, throwing enough conflicting examples of both at you at once to make each turn of the page a “wait, what?” experience."
