Spider Monkey #1 by Jesse McManus and Austin English, published by Domino Books

Spider Monkey is a tour de force from artist Jesse McManus, working from a script by Austin English, incorporating horror manga, children's comics and fantastic golden age elements into one beautiful comic.

"[D]espite the extreme and elastic surreality of both writing and art, there is remarkable clarity to the book," writes Morgan Pielli on Forbidden Planet's the Daily Planet.

Justin Giampaoli says, "Jesse McManus and Austin English offer a stark bit of originality with this offbeat story ostensibly about adventuring kids. There are so many ideas at play amid the varying-length shorts which are tangentially related here, but the feature-length story up front bears the majority of the narrative push. The panels are so rich and dense with heavy line-weighted action searching out every nook and cranny of the frame."
