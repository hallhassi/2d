An off-shoot of Joseph Gillette's 'Party Food', which is a multi-dimensional art project.

_Prizon Food_ was chosen as one of 2012's best mini-comics by the Poopsheet Foundation.

> Thereâ€™s something about the subdued humor and fantastical creations of Prizon Food that reminds me of the great Achewood by Chris Onstad...The pages feel silky and I want to rub them all over my body, err, something.

Poopsheet Foundations senior editor, Justin Giampaoli

> ...a funny, intriguing and delightfully warped comic...
