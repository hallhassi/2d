__36 pages, 5.125" x 7.125", dusk jacket, full color cover and interior__

Chipboard is a companion to both the book [_Things You Carry_](http://2dcloud.com/shop/things-you-carry/) and the exhibition of new work originally displayed at CO exhibitions in 2011 of the same name. This new work by Vincent Stall displays an evocative power not often seen in print - something akin to a ghost story from the silent film era.
