**144 pages, 7 1/2" x 10" bilingual comic with translated parts on pink paper, perfect bound, color cover, black and white (or pink) interior.** 

This is the complete (almost complete) content from the Dirty Plotte fanzine. With original French and English versions, as well as translations. It is the new version of the Drawn & Quarterly book LÃ¨ve Ta Jambe Mon, Poisson Est Mort! that has long been out of print but with lots more, including fanzine covers and other odds and ends.

Fantastic Plotte has it all in here: fatal kisses, early misadventures with tampons, ecstatic lovemaking with giant beer bottles, and a host of other strange and unconventional themes from the unfettered imagination of Ms. Doucet.
