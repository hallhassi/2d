__**AVAILABLE NOW FOR PRE-ORDER**__<br/> 

__Ships this SPRING 2015__

![blaise-larmee_ice-cream-kisses.jpg](/media/blaise-larmee_ice-cream-kisses.jpg)

288 pages, 6” x 9” smyth sewn paperback with 2 color interiors. 

Monochrome paintings and bleed-through drawings create the framework for this flood of emotion. A radical departure from his previous work in both tone and content, _Ice Cream Kisses_ reveals the author at his most arrogant and his most vulnerable.

**From the author:** _This is my second graphic novel. A sophomore effort. 288 pages of happy dizziness. A morning erection. Painting nude in the summertime. A list of things I want to do with you._

__This special pre-order comes with a copy of 'Nudes' from Studio Operative in the UK, plus a new limited run mini called 'Prologue'. Special pre-order price: $39.95__

note: _Nudes_ ships separately and from the UK. 

_**Nudes**_ is the kissing cousin across the pond to _Ice Cream Kisses_. Carrying similar figures, but narratively removed, printed and published by the UK based [Studio Operative](http://www.studio-operative.co.uk/).

_**Prologue**_ is a short zine that tangentially precludes _Ice Cream Kisses_.
