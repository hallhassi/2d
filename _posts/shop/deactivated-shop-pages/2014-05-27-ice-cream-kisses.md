__288 pages, 6” x 9” smyth sewn paperback with 2 color interiors.__ 

Monochrome paintings and bleed-through drawings create the framework for this flood of emotion. A radical departure from his previous work in both tone and content, _Ice Cream Kisses_ reveals the author at his most arrogant and his most vulnerable.

**From the author:** _This is my second graphic novel. A sophomore effort. 288 pages of happy dizziness. A morning erection. Painting nude in the summertime. A list of things I want to do with you._

This book is also available in an exclusive [Deluxe Edition](http://2dcloud.com/shop/ice-cream-kisses-special-edition-pre-order/) and at a discount via [subscription](http://2dcloud.com/shop/full-year-14-subscription/).
