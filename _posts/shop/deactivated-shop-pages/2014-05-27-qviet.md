Qviet is the sum total of Andy Burkholder’s multi-year series that focuses on the abstractions of sex, of seeing, and the fluid relations between the two, now available for the first time as a collected edition from 2DCLOUD.

Initially appearing on tumblr in 2011 as the work of an artist operating under the sole pseudonym of Tracy, Qviet intrigued the underground comics community for not only the mystery surrounding its creator, but for its unflinching approach to form and an absurdist/sardonic tone rarely found in comics.

Using the strip, one of the oldest formal modes in comics, as the misleadingly benign container for his explorations, Burkholder challenges the reader to reimagine not only what falls under the purview of this form, but the larger conceptions of sex as a set of abstract symbols that inform our daily lives.

Qviet stands as an example of the ever expanding potential of comics in the 21st century.


PRAISE for _**Qviet**_:

>In Qviet, one quickly grasps that Burkholder is interested in sex, not for its sensations, but for its cartoonishly exploitable symbols. Easy sexual representations are either avoided entirely or abstracted to the point of rebirth. A book of sex gags is sensational by nature, but Qviet diffuses its erotic energy, redirecting its pleasures for a more compelling cause -- a truly funky affront on comics form.

Scott Longo, **Sonatina Comics**

>Men’s urethras become women’s vaginas, and both become nipples or eyeballs or assholes; tears and breast milk and sweat and semen flow interchangeably, like Habibi‘s great river... If someone else out there is working this fearlessly with the silliness of sex, I’m almost afraid to find out.

Sean T. Collins, **The Comics Journal**

>Sex comics that aren't cartooned pornographic imagery or fantasy fulfillment. These are surrealist inner monologue gags of the Id, thoughts projected, constructed in the finest kinky lines. The butt of the joke is often the sexual urge itself.

Lale Westvind, **_Hot Dog Beach_**

>Qviet is an elegant animal.
