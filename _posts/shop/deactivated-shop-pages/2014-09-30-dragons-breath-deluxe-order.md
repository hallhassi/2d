**PRAISE FOR DRAGON'S BREATH!!** <br/>
<br/>

>Award-winning author MariNaomi (Kiss and Tell) returns with this charming and intimate collection of vignettes and meatier personal histories. ... The book is utterly absorbing, funny, intimate, and even philosophical. 

__[Publisher's Weekly](http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-941250-01-3)__ <br/> <br/>

>The art sparkles, combining bold, clean lines with wonderfully expressive faces. Add in a great ear for dialog, and the result is a winning collection that brings the reader genuine laughs and a powerful emotional punch. MariNaomi is definitely a name to watch in the years to come.

>Dragon's Breath is a funny, intimate and sometimes sad ode to multiplicity. Each episode comes over you like a puff of smoke, and with it comes both a little cough and the rich scent of fresh tobacco.

[**Graphic Novel Reporter**](http://www.graphicnovelreporter.com/reviews/dragons-breath-and-other-true-stories) <br/>
<br/>

>As a memoirist, MariNaomi has wit, focus, and a sense of when to stop telling a story. The comics in _Dragon’s Breath_ are both compact and emotionally resonant.

[**The Comics Journal**](http://www.tcj.com/reviews/dragons-breath/) <br/>
<br/>

>MariNaomi knows how to weave in a sense of the comic, so that moments of deep despair are always balanced with some levity and even mirth ... A highly
recommended read from a new and exciting independent publisher.

>[Dragon's Breath i]s bound to touch you...

>Mari is a brilliant artist, compelling storyteller and bonafide dragonslayer. Read her books, attend her readings [!]

[**Shakeytown Radio**](http://brodiehubbard.tumblr.com/post/98505887795/dragonsbreath) <br/>
<br/>

>Mari's comics are a special, one-of-a-kind thing. They live in this mesmerizing area of honesty and authenticity ... their quality is wildly impressive and present throughout.

[**This is Infamous**](http://thisisinfamous.com/dragons-breath-true-stories-comic-review-real-real-gets/) <br/>
<br/>

>What is so appealing is how MariNaomi shares a life, one that is distinct in its details, yet connected. Here is another woman searching for love, risk, and connection amid the hubbub of the contemporary -- boyfriends, best friends, bedbugs, exes, rock music and rentals.

[**Bookslut**](http://www.bookslut.com/thousandfurs/2014_11_020962.php) <br/>
<br/>

>MariNaomi cuts to the quick with her emotionally resonant comics collection that offers variety and a comforting voice.

[**Foreword Reviews**](https://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/dragons-breath-and-other-true-tales/) <br/>
<br/>

>[MariNaomi] reminds us about those special fleeting moments of beauty and those dark places in our psyches that we bury.
