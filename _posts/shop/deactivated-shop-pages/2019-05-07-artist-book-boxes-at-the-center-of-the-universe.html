        BOOK BOXES <br /><br />AT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE.</a><br /><br />
      Nobody is publishing weird, avant-garde, and visually innovative art comix like 2dcloud. It’s the kind of work
      that, by its very nature, will never be lucrative, but they do it because they believe in artists, and I believe
      in them.<br /><br />
      I want to see art with a unique hand. I want artists that tell stories no one else can. I want my visual
      vocabulary expanded when I look at what you do. Comics that look how a comic should look are for babies and for
      the birds.
