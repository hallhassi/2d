### Rules of thumb for all posts

- _Cross post to Tumblr_: When creating a new post, also make a teaser post for tumblr with one or two images or a quote.

- _Optimize your images_. Always use Photoshop's "export for web" option when saving images for the site. No image should be larger than 200 or 300kb. The max width for all images on the site is 800px.

- _Keep image assets centrally located_: For all externally referenced images, use flickr. Keep source images in [the DEW dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0c5b37821hcyepe/hX0pkSKqBQ). Keep product photos in the [2dcloud-product-photos folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rbks6py3sg40owo/SppKrwLxSW).

6. If the post is a series, you need to do two things: Firstly, decide on a 'series name' and make sure it is exactly the same for every entry in a series. Then, add a 'tag' to your post that matches the name of the series.

### Adding new authors

In order to attribute posts to authors, you need to create reference posts for them.

3. In the heading of the new post, add the author's full name.
4. Clear out the fillter content in the document, and leave it empty.
5. Fill out metadata tab. The author description follows the format, "(authors name)(description)", so every bio begins with a sentence that starts with the authors name. You can write HTML in this form field if you'd like (for example, to link to an author's website). _Profile images are automatically turned into circles. Use the template at (I have no idea where this went) as a starting point._
