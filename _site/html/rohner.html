        Previously published in German by Rotopol Press, Röhner is a delightfully detailed field guide to the every day
        tasks of living in an apartment — making coffee, watering plants, and maintaining order and a careful balance
        with neighbors — until that order is upset. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p class="alt">
        Max Baitinger’s dry humor and precise drawings deftly personify his über persnickety protagonist, simply
        referred to as P., whose regimented life is disrupted by the arrival of Röhner, an unloved houseguest, who
        imposes upon his psyche and offsets the careful balance with his gregarious, omnipresent neighbor. Devious
        tricks and
        hilarious imaginations of Röhner’s elimination take shape, from painstakingly making up Röhner’s guestroom and
        then
        piercing the air mattress to cause a slow leak — to visions of an exploding coffee pot tearing off Röhner’s
        face.

        Röhner expertly shows off Max's inventive draftsmanship, droll wit, and precise cartooning. It's one of my
        favorite books for 2020.

        Max is such a good observer of interpersonal relations, and therefore a great storyteller. Needless to say that
        his drawings are magnetic. I keep staring at them and think: How did he do that? Röhner is one of my favorite
        books.

        Baitinger leaves the reader in the dark about the big picture. He prefers to show details: how the protagonist
        spins his appointment calendar in the air to indicate that he has no time. The way aluminium confetti pours out
        of
        a letter onto a shag rug. Baitinger breaks up an everyday matter like brewing coffee into many small steps, each
        in an individual image: ‘Switch on boiler. Insert pot. Fill tank. Insert filter.
        &mdash; Josa Mania-Schlegel, journalist at Krautreporter</br></br>

        Baitinger has three books published and Röhner is his first English language publication.<br /><br />
        Born in Penzberg, Upper Bavaria in 1982, Max Baitinger has been drawing comics since his apprenticeship as a
        carpenter. He studied illustration at the Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst in Leipzig. His work is
        influenced
        by the Duden Pictorial Dictionary of 1992, Beautiful Living; Stories by Luise Boege and Agota Kristof. As
        described by a critic, he "designs whole worlds with a few lines." His book Heimdall was honorably mentioned
        at
        the International Comic Salon Erlangen 2014 (ICOM). The German version of Röhner was a finalist for the comic
        book award of the Berthold Leibinger Foundation and has been featured on The Goethe Institut website. It‘s
        also
        published in France and Spain. In 2017 he went on a reading tour with his latest book "Birgit", the story of
        an
        office worker. It was featured by It’s Nice That and was awarded with the German Illustrators Award "Hans Meid
        Preis". Baitinger is an organizer of "The Millionaires Club" comic festival in Leipzig and he works as a
        freelance cartoonist and illustrator. <br /><br />
